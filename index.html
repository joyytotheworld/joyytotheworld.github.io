            <p><span class="color">ENHYPEN</span> is a K-POP group formed by formed by Belift Lab. In 2020, there was a survival show called "I-LAND". There were about 12 K-POP trainees
                who were chosen to be part of the show. The contestants were given missions to do. For example, they had to prepare a performance and perform it infront
                of judges after a few days of practice. The group who did the best performance will stay in I-Land, and the other group will go to the Ground. 
                The contestants in I-Land have a chance of debuting, while the contestants in the Ground have to do a better performance than the contestants in I-Land during 
                the next performance to go to I-Land and have a chance of debuting. Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Niki were the 7 contestants who were 
                given the privilage of debuting. Their journey of being K-POP artists began in November 30, 2020. Since then, they've made about 9 albums.

            <p>The 7 members are Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Niki. Jungwon is the leader and my bias. He's known for his leadership,
                dancing skills, and his visuals. Many <span class="color">Engenes</span> (fandom name) think of him as a cat because of his facial features. Niki is the maknae and another one of
                my biases. He's known for his dancing skills and being the tallest in the group even when he's the youngest. Heeseung is the eldest, and is known for 
                his vocal skills. Sunghoon is known for his background as a figure skater who would compete in competitions. Sunoo is known for his visuals, and both 
                Jay and Jake are known for their stage presence.
